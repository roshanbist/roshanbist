# Hi, I'm Roshan Bist 👋

I’m a software developer with experience in building high-performance web applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. I enjoy creating pixel-perfect, responsive interfaces and building scalable backend systems that work smoothly together.

🚀 I’ve developed production-grade applications using MongoDB, Docker, and CI/CD during my time at Integrify Academy. I also hold an MSc in Computing Sciences from Tampere University. My journey from Nepal to Finland has been all about creating interactive, user-focused solutions that work across all devices.

🛠 I’ve worked in agile, cross-functional teams and value collaboration, iteration, and user-centered development. I enjoy solving problems across the stack and take pride in writing clean, accessible, and maintainable code.

Outside of coding, I explore visual storytelling through photography, one frame at a time 📷

If you're building something meaningful and looking for a developer who blends frontend skills with full-stack experience, let’s connect 🤝
