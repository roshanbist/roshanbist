# Hi, I'm Roshan Bist ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated and aspiring full-stack developer based in Tampere, Finland. I recently earned my Masterâ€™s Degree in Computing Science with a specialization in Software, Web, and Cloud from Tampere University. My passion lies in creating responsive websites and continually learning new technologies to enhance my skill set. In addition to coding, I have a keen interest in photography. Capturing moments through my lens allows me to explore my creativity from a different perspective.
